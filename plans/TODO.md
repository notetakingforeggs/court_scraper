## TODO

- use spring jpa/hibernate to create tables in db
- Scraper should scrape and add all the data to the db separately
- make parent git to host both spring project and scraper in one repo


### Scraper
- find all links
- iterate through and find all urls
- iterate through and send requests getting new response to make soup with
- parse the data in this new soup and add to the 

maybe make tables for regions and citys independently rather than trying to scrape it so you can just scrape the court name and data from each page and link it with foreign keys etc..
